Originally provided by Stateminder: A data visualization project from Georgetown University. www.stateminder.org (no longer accessible online)
Notes: The number of ineligible felons depends on state law. Some states permanently disfranchise felons and a few let even prisoners vote. Statistics drawn from various Department of Justice reports which detail the prison, probation, and parole population of the United States are matched with these state laws to estimate the number of ineligible felons. The Department of Justice Bureau, Office of Justice Statistics releases numbers from Jan. 1 through Dec. 31 for a given year. Author uses the most approximate Jan. 1 values, where available, since these include revised Dec. 31 data from the previous year. Author assumes all Prisoners and Parolees are felons, and half of Probationers are felons (this estimate is drawn from DOJ reports; starting in 2011, DOJ reports the number of persons on probation who are felons). A blank or zero indicates the category of felons is allowed to vote in that state. For the United States totals, author includes persons in the federal corrections system.",elections,"McDonald, Michael P. “Turnout 1980-2012” United States Election Project. http://www.electproject.org/  Accessed 9-17-2021","@article{mcdonald2021turnout,

United States Election Project. Turnout 1980-2012. http://www.electproject.org/. Originally provided by Stateminder: A data visualization project from Georgetown University. www.stateminder.org (no longer accessible online)
Notes: VEP Highest Office Turnout Rate = (Voted for Highest Office) / (Voting-Eligible Population Total) (recommended statistic).
The Vote for Highest Office is the traditional reported number of people who voted in a given election. In presidential election years, the vote for highest office is simply the presidential vote. In a non-presidential election year, the vote for highest office is the largest vote total for a statewide office such as governor or US Senator. When no statewide office is on the ballot, the sum of the congressional races is used instead. In 2006, the methodology was changed slightly to use the sum of the congressional races if they exceeded a statewide office, as occurred with Indiana's uncompetitive US Senate race.",elections,"McDonald, Michael P. “Turnout 1980-2012” United States Election Project. http://www.electproject.org/  Accessed 9-17-2021","@article{mcdonald2021turnout,

Notes: for an even-year, in an even-year election state with all of a chamber's seats up, this would give one-fourth weight to the current election, one-half weight to the last election, and one-fourth weight to the second to last election. For an odd year in such a state, half weight would be given to the election held last year, and half weight would be given to the election before that. WARNING: users can drop the even years in even year states if they don't like the one-fourth/one-half/one-fourth weighting referred to above. For states with four-year election cycles, like Alabama, users might consider only keeping the values from three years after the calendar year of the election.

Notes: for an even-year, in an even-year election state with all of a chamber's seats up, this would give one-fourth weight to the current election, one-half weight to the last election, and one-fourth weight to the second to last election. For an odd year in such a state, half weight would be given to the election held last year, and half weight would be given to the election before that. WARNING: users can drop the even years in even year states if they don't like the one-fourth/one-half/one-fourth weighting referred to above. For states with four-year election cycles, like Alabama, users might consider only keeping the values from three years after the calendar year of the election. Candidates in FFA-MMDs have their % multiplied by the number of seats in the FFA-MMD. After computing this quantity for both chambers, those two quantities are averaged.",elections,"Ranney, Austin. 1976. “Parties in State Politics.” In Politics in the American States, 3rd ed., edited by Jacob, Herbert and Vines, Kenneth.

Notes: Total energy average price is derived by dividing the total energy total expenditures in the residential sector by the total energy consumed by the residential sector, across each state, and multiplying the result by a thousand. Data is adjusted for process fuel, intermediate products, and fuels with no direct cost. Residential sector is defined as an energy-consuming sector that consists of living quarters for private households. Energy is defined as the capacity for doing work as measured by the capability of doing work (potential energy) or the conversion of this capability to motion (kinetic energy).",environment,U.S. Energy Information Administration - EIA - Independent Statistics and Analysis.
