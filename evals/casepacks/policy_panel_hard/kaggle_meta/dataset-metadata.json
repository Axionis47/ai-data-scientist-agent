These variables represent policy outputs or political, social, or economic factors that may influence policy differences. The codebook includes the variable name, a short description of the variable, the variable time frame, a longer description of the variable, and the variable source(s) and notes.\\n\\n**See the codebook files for detailed column description**\\n\\n# Citations\\n\\n&gt;This aggregated dataset is only possible because many scholars and students have spent countless hours creating, collecting, cleaning, and making data publicly available. Thus, if you use the dataset, please cite the original data sources. To quickly generate these citations, see our web application or R package(link is external) - both can export citations for any variable in the dataset. For example, if you use the dataset to examine the relationship between the Policy Innovativeness Score created by Boehmke & Skinner (2012) and the Policy Liberalism Score created by Caughey & Warshaw (2015), you should include the following three citations:\\n     - Boehmke, Frederick J., and Paul Skinner. 2012. \\u201cState Policy Innovativeness Revisited.\\u201d State Politics and Policy Quarterly 12(3):303-29.\\n     - Caughey, Devin, and Christopher Warshaw. 2015. \\u201cThe Dynamics of State Policy Liberalism, 1936\\u20132014.\\u201d American Journal of Political Science 60 (4): 899\\u2013913. \\n     - Grossmann, M., Jordan, M.
