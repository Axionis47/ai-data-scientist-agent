## ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Error Handling** ⭐⭐⭐

**Current State:**
- Many try-except blocks with generic exception handling
- Some errors silently swallowed (e.g., `except Exception: pass`)
- Limited error context propagation to users

**Recommendations:**
- Implement custom exception hierarchy
- Add more specific error messages for common failures
- Surface actionable errors to frontend (e.g., "Column 'target' not found in dataset")
- Add retry logic for transient failures

### 2. **Testing Coverage** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Current State:**
- Good coverage (70%+) but could be higher
- 17 test files for 35 source files (48% file coverage)
- Limited integration tests for full pipeline
- No load/stress testing

**Recommendations:**
- Add end-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Test edge cases (empty datasets, single-row data, all-null columns)
- Add performance benchmarks
- Test concurrent job handling
- Add frontend E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress)

### 3. **Documentation** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Current State:**
- Excellent architecture docs (ARCHITECTURE.md, FILES.md, API.md)
- Good inline comments
- README covers basics well

**Recommendations:**
- Add user guide with examples
- Document common troubleshooting scenarios
- Add API examples with curl/Python
- Create developer onboarding guide
- Add architecture diagrams (current flow is text-only)

### 4. **Performance Optimization** ⭐⭐⭐

**Current State:**
- Chunked reading for large files ✅
- Early stopping for huge datasets ✅
- No caching layer
- No async processing for independent tasks

**Recommendations:**
- Cache EDA results for repeated analyses
- Parallelize independent modeling candidates
- Add Redis for distributed job queue
- Implement result pagination for large outputs
- Add database for job metadata (currently file-based)

### 5. **ML Model Management** ⭐⭐⭐

**Current State:**
- Models trained per-job but not persisted
- No model versioning
- No A/B testing framework
- Limited model monitoring

**Recommendations:**
- Add model serialization (pickle/joblib)
- Implement model registry (MLflow)
- Add prediction endpoints for trained models
- Track model drift over time
- Add model retraining triggers

### 6. **Frontend Enhancements** ⭐⭐⭐

**Current State:**
- Functional but basic UI
- Limited data preview
- No inline editing of parameters
- Polling-based updates (not WebSocket)

**Recommendations:**
- Add dataset preview before analysis
- Show live logs during processing
- Add parameter tuning UI (CV folds, model selection)
- Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- Add data visualization builder
- Export results to PDF/Excel
