# Phase 1: Foundation Audit & Baseline

## Phase Overview

**Duration**: 2 weeks (Weeks 1-2)
**Team**: 1 DevOps Engineer + 1 Senior Developer
**Status**: 🟢 Ready to Start

## Objectives

1. **Establish Baseline**: Document current state of codebase, infrastructure, and processes
2. **Identify Gaps**: Discover technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and quality issues
3. **Prioritize Work**: Create actionable remediation roadmap for subsequent phases
4. **Set Standards**: Define quality gates and success criteria for the project

## Scope

### In Scope
- ✅ Code quality analysis (static analysis, linting, type checking)
- ✅ Dependency audit (vulnerabilities, licenses, outdated packages)
- ✅ Test coverage analysis (unit, integration, e2e)
- ✅ Security baseline assessment (secrets, PII handling, API security)
- ✅ Configuration audit (environment variables, config management)
- ✅ Documentation review (completeness, accuracy, maintainability)
- ✅ Performance baseline (execution time, memory usage)
- ✅ Technical debt inventory (code smells, anti-patterns)

### Out of Scope
- ❌ Infrastructure provisioning (Phase 4)
- ❌ Deployment automation (Phase 5)
- ❌ Production monitoring setup (Phase 6)
- ❌ Penetration testing (Phase 7)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete audit report with findings and recommendations
- [ ] Baseline metrics established for all quality dimensions
- [ ] All critical security vulnerabilities identified

   - Dependency graph

3. **Test Coverage Analysis** (`03-FINDINGS/test-coverage-analysis.md`)
   - Current coverage metrics
   - Untested code paths
   - Test quality assessment
   - Coverage improvement plan

4. **Security Baseline Assessment** (`03-FINDINGS/security-baseline.md`)
   - Secrets management review
   - PII handling audit
   - API security assessment
   - Security recommendations

5. **Technical Debt Inventory** (`03-FINDINGS/technical-debt-inventory.md`)
   - Code smells and anti-patterns
   - Architectural issues
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Refactoring priorities

6. **Remediation Roadmap** (`04-ARTIFACTS/remediation-roadmap.md`)
   - Prioritized action items
   - Effort estimates
   - Risk assessment
   - Quick wins vs. long-term improvements

## Timeline

### Week 1: Analysis & Data Collection
- **Day 1-2**: Setup tooling, run automated scans
- **Day 3-4**: Manual code review, documentation review
- **Day 5**: Consolidate findings, initial analysis

### Week 2: Reporting & Planning
- **Day 6-7**: Write audit reports, create visualizations
- **Day 8-9**: Develop remediation roadmap, prioritize work
- **Day 10**: Review, validation, handoff preparation

## Tools & Technologies

### Code Quality
- **mypy**: Type checking
- **pylint**: Linting and code quality
- **black**: Code formatting check
- **isort**: Import sorting check
- **radon**: Code complexity metrics
- **flake8**: Style guide enforcement

### Security

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Tools not compatible with Python 3.12 | Medium | Low | Test tools in isolated environment first |
| Large number of findings overwhelming | High | Medium | Prioritize by severity and impact |
| Incomplete documentation | Medium | Medium | Interview team members for context |
| OpenAI API costs for testing | Low | High | Use mocked tests where possible |
| Time overrun on manual review | Medium | Medium | Focus on critical paths first |
