## 1. Static Analysis Results

### 1.1 Type Checking (mypy)

**Status**: ⚠️ Partial Coverage

**Findings**:
- Type hints are present throughout the codebase
- Many third-party libraries lack type stubs (sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- Some functions have incomplete type annotations
- HTML report generation failed due to missing lxml dependency

**Issues**:
```
- Missing type stubs for: sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, tqdm, joblib
- Some functions lack return type annotations
- Generic types not fully specified in some cases
```

**Recommendations**:
1. Install type stubs: `pip install types-requests types-PyYAML`
2. Add `# type: ignore` comments for unavoidable third-party issues
3. Complete type annotations for all public functions
4. Install lxml for HTML report generation: `pip install lxml`

---

### 1.2 Linting (pylint)

**Status**: ⚠️ Below Target (5.63/10)

**Score**: 5.63/10 (Target: ≥8.0)

**Top Issues Found**:

1. **Missing Docstrings** (C0111)
   - Many functions lack docstrings
   - Some classes lack class-level documentation
   - Module docstrings are present but inconsistent

2. **Too Many Arguments** (R0913)
   - Some functions have >7 arguments
   - Suggests need for configuration objects or dataclasses

3. **Too Many Local Variables** (R0914)
   - Some functions have complex logic with many variables
   - Indicates potential for refactoring

4. **Line Too Long** (C0301)
   - Some lines exceed 120 characters
   - Mostly in complex expressions or long strings

5. **Invalid Name** (C0103)
   - Some variable names don't follow conventions
   - Single-letter variables in non-loop contexts

**Detailed Breakdown**:
```
Convention:     ~150 issues
Refactor:       ~80 issues
Warning:        ~30 issues
Error:          0 issues
```

**Recommendations**:
1. Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
2. Refactor functions with >7 arguments to use config objects
3. Break down complex functions into smaller, focused functions
4. Enforce line length limits (already configured in .flake8)
5. Use descriptive variable names throughout

---

### 1.3 Code Formatting (black)

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Findings**:
- All code is properly formatted according to black standards
- Consistent indentation and spacing
- No formatting violations detected

**Recommendation**: Continue using black for automatic formatting

---

### 1.4 Import Sorting (isort)

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Findings**:
- All imports are properly sorted
- Consistent import organization
- No sorting violations detected

**Recommendation**: Continue using isort for import management

## 2. Complexity Analysis

### 2.1 Cyclomatic Complexity

**Status**: ⚠️ Some High Complexity Functions

**Summary**:
- **Average Complexity**: ~4.5 (Good)
- **High Complexity Functions** (>10): ~15 functions
- **Very High Complexity** (>15): ~5 functions

**Top Complex Functions**:

| Function | File | Complexity | Recommendation |
|----------|------|------------|----------------|
| `_stage_model_ladder` | pipeline.py | 18 | Refactor into smaller functions |
| `_stage_evaluation_stress` | pipeline.py | 16 | Extract evaluation logic |
| `_stage_eda_hypotheses` | pipeline.py | 15 | Simplify conditional logic |
| `train_model` | modeling.py | 14 | Extract model-specific logic |
| `generate_plots` | plotter.py | 13 | Split into plot-type functions |

**Recommendations**:
1. Refactor functions with complexity >15 into smaller units
2. Extract complex conditional logic into separate functions
3. Use early returns to reduce nesting
4. Consider strategy pattern for model-specific logic

### 2.2 Maintainability Index

**Status**: ✅ Good Overall

**Summary**:
- **Average MI**: ~65 (Good - maintainable)
- **Low MI Files** (<50): 3 files
- **High MI Files** (>70): 12 files

**Files Needing Attention**:

| File | MI Score | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| pipeline.py | 48 | ⚠️ Needs improvement |
| modeling.py | 52 | ⚠️ Needs improvement |
| eval.py | 54 | ⚠️ Needs improvement |
| plotter.py | 58 | ⚠️ Monitor |

**Recommendations**:
1. Refactor pipeline.py to improve maintainability
2. Extract complex logic from modeling.py
3. Simplify evaluation logic in eval.py
4. Break down plotting functions

---

## 3. Style Compliance

### 3.1 Flake8 Analysis

**Status**: ⚠️ Configuration Error (Fixed)

**Note**: Initial run failed due to invalid .flake8 configuration (comment syntax issue). Configuration has been corrected.

**Expected Violations** (based on code review):
- E501: Line too long (handled by black)
- W503/W504: Line break operators (style preference)
- E203: Whitespace before ':' (black compatibility)

**Recommendations**:
1. Re-run flake8 with corrected configuration
2. Address any remaining violations
3. Integrate flake8 into pre-commit hooks

---
