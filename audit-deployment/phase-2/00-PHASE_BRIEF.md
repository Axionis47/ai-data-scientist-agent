   - Enable stricter mypy checks
   - **Target**: 80%+ type coverage

4. **Pre-commit Hooks** (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
   - black formatting
   - isort import sorting
   - pylint checks
   - mypy type checking
   - pytest quick tests

5. **Enhanced CI/CD** (`.github/workflows/`)

   - Automated linting and type checking
   - Security scanning

6. **Documentation Updates**
   - Testing guide
   - Contributing guide updates
   - Code quality standards

## Tools & Technologies

### Testing
- **pytest**: Test framework
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage measurement
- **pytest-mock**: Mocking framework
- **pytest-xdist**: Parallel test execution
- **unittest.mock**: Python mocking
- **responses**: HTTP mocking for OpenAI API

### Code Quality
- **pylint**: Linting (already configured)
- **mypy**: Type checking (already configured)
- **black**: Formatting (already configured)
- **isort**: Import sorting (already configured)
- **radon**: Complexity analysis (already configured)

### CI/CD
- **pre-commit**: Git hooks framework
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD platform

- **Audit Reports**: Detailed findings and recommendations
- **Configuration Files**: .pylintrc, mypy.ini, .bandit, .flake8

## Outputs to Phase 3

- **Updated Documentation**: Testing guide, contributing guide

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Mocking OpenAI is complex | HIGH | MEDIUM | Use responses library, create reusable fixtures |
| Coverage target too ambitious | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Adjust to 70% if needed, focus on critical paths |
| Refactoring introduces bugs | HIGH | LOW | Write tests first, then refactor |
| Time overrun on docstrings | LOW | MEDIUM | Use AI assistance, focus on public APIs |
| Pre-commit hooks slow down dev | LOW | MEDIUM | Make hooks fast, allow skip for WIP commits |

## Dependencies

- Phase 1 complete ‚úÖ
- OpenAI API key for limited testing (mocked for most tests)
- Team availability
- Stakeholder approval

## Stakeholders

- **Project Sponsor**: Engineering Lead
- **Phase Owner**: Senior Developer
