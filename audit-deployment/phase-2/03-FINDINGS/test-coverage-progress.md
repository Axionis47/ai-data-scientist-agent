## Current Test Statistics

```
Total Tests: 173
Passing: 145 (84%)
Failing: 28 (16%)
Warnings: 37 (mostly deprecation warnings)
```

### Test Execution Time
- **Unit tests**: ~1.12 seconds
- **Average per test**: ~6.5ms

---

## Issues Identified

### 1. API Mismatch in Tests (28 tests)

**Problem**: Tests for `profiling.py` and `features.py` expect direct data return, but actual implementation returns:
```python
{
    "profile_ref": "/path/to/profile.json",  # Reference to saved file
    "hash": "sha256:...",
    "summary": {...}  # High-level summary only
}
```

**Solution**: Update tests to:
1. Check for `profile_ref` or `splits_ref` in result
2. Load the actual data from the JSON file
3. Verify the data structure

**Estimated Fix Time**: 1-2 hours

### 2. Deprecation Warnings (37 warnings)

**Issues**:
- Pydantic V1 `@validator` â†’ V2 `@field_validator` (1 warning)
- `datetime.utcnow()` â†’ `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` (36 warnings)

**Impact**: Low (warnings only, not errors)
**Priority**: Medium (should fix during code quality improvements)

## Recommendations

### 1. Prioritize High-Value Tests

Focus on:
- **Core business logic**: modeling, evaluation, features
- **Critical paths**: pipeline stages, data flow
- **Error handling**: edge cases, validation

### 2. Use Test Fixtures Effectively

Current fixtures are working well:
- `conftest.py` provides comprehensive shared fixtures
- Reusable data fixtures reduce test code duplication
- Mock fixtures for OpenAI prevent API costs

### 3. Balance Coverage vs. Quality

- Don't chase 100% coverage on low-value code
- Focus on meaningful tests that catch real bugs
- Aim for 80% overall, 95%+ on critical modules

### 4. Address Deprecation Warnings

- Update Pydantic validators during Day 8 (code quality)
- Fix datetime warnings in utils.py
- Will improve Pylint score
