## 🎯 Coverage Analysis

### What's Well Covered (≥90%)
1. **Configuration Management** (99%) - Comprehensive validation
2. **Context & Logging** (98%) - Full tracking coverage
3. **Data Profiling** (96%) - Schema and quality checks
4. **Utilities** (96%) - File I/O and helpers
5. **Plotting** (94%) - Visualization tools
6. **Modeling** (94%) - Training and tuning
7. **Metrics** (92%) - Evaluation functions
8. **Caching** (91%) - Cache modes and tracking

### What Needs More Coverage (<80%)
1. **Pipeline** (44%) - Complex integration, LLM-dependent
2. **Features** (63%) - Feature engineering transformations
3. **Budget** (67%) - Budget enforcement scenarios

### Why Pipeline Coverage is Lower
The pipeline module (44% coverage) is intentionally lower because:
- **Complex Integration**: Orchestrates all 7 stages with LLM calls
- **LLM Dependency**: Requires extensive mocking of OpenAI API
- **Stage Complexity**: Each stage has multiple decision points
- **Diminishing Returns**: Testing individual stages requires mocking entire tool ecosystem

**Decision**: Focus on testing individual tools (which are well-covered) rather than complex integration scenarios.

## 🚀 Path to 90% Coverage

To reach 90% coverage, we would need:

### 1. Pipeline Module (44% → 70%)
- **Needed**: ~30 more tests
- **Focus**: Individual stage methods with comprehensive mocking
- **Effort**: High (requires mocking LLM and all tools)
- **Value**: Medium (integration tests more valuable)

### 2. Features Module (63% → 85%)
- **Needed**: ~15 more tests
- **Focus**: Featurizer.apply() with different strategies
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Value**: High

### 3. Budget Module (67% → 85%)
- **Needed**: ~10 more tests
- **Focus**: Budget enforcement and downshift scenarios
- **Effort**: Low
- **Value**: High

**Total Estimated Effort**: ~55 additional tests, 3-4 hours

4. **Mocking strategy** - Isolated tests from external dependencies

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Complex APIs** - Learned actual method signatures through exploration
2. **LLM mocking** - Successfully mocked OpenAI API calls
3. **File I/O** - Used tmp_path fixtures for clean tests
4. **Integration complexity** - Focused on unit tests over integration

### Best Practices Established
1. **Test first, fix later** - Write tests, then fix failures
2. **Check actual APIs** - Always verify method signatures
3. **Use fixtures** - Reusable test data and setup
4. **Mock external deps** - Isolate tests from external services
